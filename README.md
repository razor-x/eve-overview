## Description

### Overview Pack

An exhaustive and customizable overview pack:
download from the [main site](https://io.evansosenko.com/eve-overview/).
For questions, submit a new GitHub issue.

_I only update this pack when I'm actively playing EVE.
If you would like me to release an update, please submit an issue._

### Generator

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/razor-x/eve-overview)

The EVE Online Overview Generator facilitates creating and maintaining overview packs.

Essentially, you define a common set of LEGO bricks and build your overviews with them.

First, create overviews out of game by editing a set of YAML files.
Then, generate importable overview files by running the included Ruby script.

Rather than a single YAML file per overview, the various overview settings are split
into many files which can be reused to create custom overviews
based on a set of common groups, presets, settings, etc.
The modular design makes updating, sharing, and customizing simple.
